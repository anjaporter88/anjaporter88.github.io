									I am a Creative Professional with a background in IT Services and Testing. I was born in Berlin but moved to Brighton in 2010. I love cats, my husband and true crime... (in that order üòâ).
									<br />
									I was made redundant late last summer (2020) and have taken the opportunity to retrain into the Creative Industries which is something I've always wanted to do, ever since I stuck magazine pictures together with glue at age 14. 
									<br />
									<br />
									<span class="i-do">üë©‚Äçüé®  Now I illustrate, I design & I code  üë©‚Äçüíª</span>
									<br />
									Initially, I completed a UX Bootcamp as the field of User Experience brings together my love of human behaviour, technology and design. I loved that journey but felt I wanted to boost my creative skills further.
									<br />
									I am now continuing to follow my curiosity and learning web development and graphic design. This balance of logic and beauty brings me such joy at the moment. I'm hoping you can see that in my work!
									<br>
									In terms of work experience -
